Conservation hackers is helping conserve nature by making data science more accessible to conservation scientists and
practitioners.

Data science skills are powerful conservation tools, they can help us map and better understand ecosystems and people's interactions with nature. But data science requires quantitative skills in computer programming that can be daunting to learn. We are helping to overcome this barrier by training conservation scientists in data science.

For some people there just isn't the time to learn analytical skills for themselves, they might have bigger issues to deal with. That's why we also help connect conservation practitioners with the data scientists that can solve their analysis issues.
