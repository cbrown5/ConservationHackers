# A review of free conservation and ecology R tutorials

You're at your computer and R is open. You've got an exciting new dataset to work with and keen to get started on some analysis, but not sure how. Perhaps you want to clean your data first and do some exploration. Or perhaps you have a specific question in mind, but you're not sure what analysis will help you find the answer.  

Next you try surfing the web to find some help. It turns out there are a lot of excellent (and free!) R resources online.  

To make the process of finding help easier, weâ€™ve compiled a list of free online R tutorials with a conservation and ecology focus. We provide a comparison of the content available in each. The aim is to help you quickly find answers to your R queries, whether it be data wrangling, spatial analysis, or more complex statistical procedures.

The database will remain a [live document] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ogq9M0-OiDdgxLAichr9yBNupzmTeSZELO6POB9J-jk/edit#gid=0). We encourage anyone reading this post to add to the database with tutorials we may have missed.  

#### Here we provide an overview of websites with free R tutorials and how they can help you.

The table above highlights that, as ecologists and conservation scientists, we are part of a supportive community of experts that are enthusiastic about sharing knowledge. 

Conservation Hackers hopes to contribute by facilitating connections between individuals seeking help and those that are able to offer it. We'll also aim to fill some of the gaps in tutorial content, such as multivariate analyses, in upcoming [courses] (https://www.conservationhackers.org/courses.html).
